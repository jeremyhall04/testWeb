        <p>Edmontosaurus mummy in the American Museum of Natural History is an exceptionally well-preserved fossil of a dinosaur,
          the first found to include a skeleton encased in skin impressions; almost two-thirds of the skin is preserved. Discovered
          in 1908 in the United States near Lusk, Wyoming, it is ascribed to the species Edmontosaurus annectens, a hadrosaurid (duck-billed dinosaur).
          </p>
        <p class="dark">It was discovered lying on its back, its neck twisted backwards and its forelimbs outstretched. After dehydration and burial of the carcass, bacteria
          consolidated the surrounding sediments, resulting in its excellent preservation. Skin impressions found in between the fingers were once interpreted as
          evidence for an aquatic lifestyle. The mummy was found by fossil hunter Charles Hazelius Sternberg and his three sons in the Lance Formation.
          Although Sternberg was working under contract to the British Museum of Natural History, Henry Fairfield Osborn managed to secure the mummy for
          the American museum.</p>
